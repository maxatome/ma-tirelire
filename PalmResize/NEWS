Feburary 16, 2005:
     Better fullscreen mode with Mobile-Stream's Landscape utility.

December 15, 2004:
     Fixed status bar area call for Palm DIA.

December 9:
     Support full screen mode for Palm DIA via DIA_STATE_NO_STATUS_BAR.
     Software that already uses this to support Sony full screen mode 
     will theoretically need only a recompile.  Released as 1.2.4.

November:
     Handera fix.  Released as 1.2.3.

September 28-29, 2004:
     Fixed tapwave problem.  Released as 1.2.2.

September 26, 2004:
     Added prototype for HandleResizeNotifications() to resize.h.
     Fixed demo for Sony.

September 26, 2004:
     Fixed a Sony bug in SetDIAState().  Released as 1.2.1.

September 4, 2004:
     No need for SUPPORT_DIA_PALM.  Revamped PALM DIA support to take into 
     account a reentrancy issue.  The fix will not work for a fully
     multitasking system, but should do the job for now.  Added a little
     demo program.

August 17, 2004:
     Easier Handera support.

July 2, 2004:
     Fixed bug with DIA_H_GRANULAR (undesired font change).  #Included config.h
     in resize.h.


June 28, 2004:

     Fixed fix of Sony bug.
     
     Fixed iQue 3600 bug.

June 17-18, 2004:

     Fixed Sony bug.

     Faster handling of nilEvent.

     DIA_H_GRANULAR attribute for forcing height of list or field to be
     an integral number of rows.

June 16, 2004:
     Fixed use of globals in notification handler.
     
     Fixed movement of right- and bottom- aligned stuff.

May 5, 2004:
     Code tweaks for C++ compiler compatibility, removal of warnings, and fixing
     typo in resize.h.

May 1, 2004:
     The per-event-type ResizeHandle*Event() functions should no longer be used 
     (though backwards compatibility will be retained for a while).  Instead, 
     you should use a single ResizeHandleEvent( event ) call in each handler.
     See DIA.txt.  This will let me make deeper changes in the resize code 
     without requiring changes in the app.  I am going to try to keep changes
     that require changes in app code to a minimum, but I needed this.
